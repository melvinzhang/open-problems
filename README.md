# Algorithms for Robotics

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/ is the plugin released by MS. It turns Minecraft into a robot simulator.

https://github.com/melvinzhang/malmopy uses Python + Malmo to teach some basic robotics algorithms like maze
solving. 

Develop more missions such as simulating how a robotic vacuum cleaner works (learns a new place and also clean it at the same time).
