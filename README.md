# Algorithms for Robotics

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/ is the plugin released by MS. It turns Minecraft into a robot simulator.

https://github.com/melvinzhang/malmopy uses Python + Malmo to teach some basic robotics algorithms like maze
solving. 

Develop more missions such as simulating a robotic vacuum cleaner which covers all locations of a new area with fewest moves (online graph exploration).

# Analysis of public dataset

Example of NYC taxi data visualization on https://www.kaggle.com/muhammedazamkhan/interactive-data-visualization-nyc-taxi-trip

For example, figure out what is the fewest taxis to service all the trips.

See https://data.gov.sg/ for other datasets from the Singapore.
