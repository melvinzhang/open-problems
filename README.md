# Analysis of public dataset

Example of NYC taxi data visualization on https://www.kaggle.com/muhammedazamkhan/interactive-data-visualization-nyc-taxi-trip

For example, figure out what is the fewest number of taxis to service all the trips.

See https://data.gov.sg/ for other datasets from the Singapore.

# Online Task Assignment

Find a strategy of assigning delivery tasks to workers so as to minimize the number of workers.

Each task must not wait more than T units of time for a worker.


# Route planning for multiple robots

Plan the movement of m robots in a warehouse that avoids deadlocks and completes all delivery tasks in the minimum time.


# Route planning for a robot vacuum cleaner

Plan the movement of a single robot vacuum cleaner to clean an area in the shortest time.

The area may be known or unknown. Should account for direction of the robot as most robots can either turn or move forward.


# Robotic missions in Minecraft

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/ is the plugin released by MS. It turns Minecraft into a robot simulator.

https://github.com/melvinzhang/malmopy uses Python + Malmo to teach some basic robotics algorithms like maze
solving.

Develop more missions such as simulating a robotic vacuum cleaner which covers all locations of a new area with fewest moves (online graph exploration).
